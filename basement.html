    <h1>The Basement</h1>
    <p>You find yourself in the basement of the house. All along the walls you
      find skulls and blood. There appears to be a pentagram drawn in blood on
      the floor where you are standing. You can investigate further or you can
      leave the basement through the door.</p>
