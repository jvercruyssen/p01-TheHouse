    <h1>The Room</h1>
    <p>You find yourself in a dark room. You reach to touch the wall and search
      for a lightswitch. Instead of a light, you find that your hand touches
      something wet. You jump back and the light from the hallway shows your
      hand is now coated in red. You can either attempt to locate a light in
      the room, or you can return to the hallway.</p>
      <ul class="choice">
        <li><a href="end.html">Enter the room again and continue to look for a light.</a></li>
        <li><a href="hall.html">Return to the hallway.</a></li>
