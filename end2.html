    <h1>The End</h1>
    <p>You continue to investigate the room. You find a loaded shotgun in the
      hands of a skeleton on the ground. As you pick up the shotgun, you feel
      as if something is behind you. Upon turning around you find a demon
      standing behind you. You unload a shot from the gun in his head, killing
      the demon. You set the gun back down and leave the house.</p>
